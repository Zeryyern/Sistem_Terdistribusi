# 🌐 Sistem Terdistribusi – Weekly Assignments

This repository contains my coursework and solutions for the **Distributed Systems (Sistem Terdistribusi)** class.  
Each week’s assignment is organized in its own folder with code, reports, and supporting files. The repo serves both as my personal progress log and as a reference for future projects in distributed computing.

## 📖 About the Course
Distributed Systems focuses on how multiple independent computers communicate, coordinate, and function together as a single system.  
Key topics include:
- Communication between processes
- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) & gRPC
- REST APIs
- Fault tolerance
- Synchronization and consistency
- Scalability and performance
